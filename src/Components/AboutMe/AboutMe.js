                maintainable web applications that meet business requirements
                and user needs. My technical skills include proficiency in
                JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and related frameworks and libraries.

                and collaboration abilities that allow me to work effectively
                with team members, stakeholders, and clients. My attention to
                detail, problem-solving skills, and commitment to quality ensure
